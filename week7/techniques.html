    <br>
    If you plan to go to bed by 11:00, stop eating at 8:00. Plan to not have three hours between your last meal of the day and the time you plan to sleep. 
    <br>
    Having a smaller dinner and spreading out those calories throughout the day may also help prevent weight gain from late meals.

<h4 style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"><strong><em>
    <br>
Lullabies and soft tunes used on children can be translated to adult lives to aid in having sounder sleep
<br>
<br>
In one study, adults who listened to 45 minutes of music before going to sleep reported having better sleep quality beginning on the very first night.
<br>
<br>
Even more encouraging is that this benefit appears to have a cumulative effect with study participants reporting better sleep the more often they incorporated music into their nightly routine.
<br>
<br>
Decrease in time it takes to fall asleep:
27 to 69 minutes to fall asleep versus 6 to 13 minutes with music.
<br>
<br>
Why does this work? The ability to hear music depends on a series of steps that convert sound waves coming into the ear into electrical signals in the brain. 
<br>
Music triggers the release of dopamine and regulates the hormones in a person.

<h2 style="background-color: #003366; text-align: center; font-style: italic;"><strong><em>Regulating Light</em></strong>
<h4 style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"><strong><em>
    <br>
Light with shorter wavelengths will impact melatonin levels and prevent one from getting solid sleep. Blue light is a prime example of this, 
<br>
and it may be recommended to use blue light filters on electronic devices towards the end of oneâ€™s day.
<br>
<br>
It is recommended to sleep with as much darkness as possible. One way to attain this may be using a blindfold
<br>
<br>
Nightlights can still be considered for they can help with stress relief. This is helpful for children who are afraid of the dark. 
<br>
However, they can lead to having less deep sleep, so use them at your own risk.
