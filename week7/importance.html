    Stress resulting from lack of sleep:
    <br>
    <br>
    ~ Being less mentally sharp at work can jeopardize your performance and potentially cause problems on the job.
    <br>
    ~ Getting sick more often puts you under pressure and additional stress.
    <br>
    ~ Experiencing emotional reactivity can cause conflict with co-workers, family, and friends.
    <br>
    <br>
    Being more prone to accidents obviously has its own set of dangers on the mind. More than 70 types of sleep disorders exist,
    <br>
    and this can even increase the risk of developing sleep apnea and even depression. People with ADHD are more prone to having sleeping disorders,
    <br>
    including difficulty falling asleep, shorter sleep duration, and restless slumber. Not only that, but people who do not get enough sleep are more prone to inattentiveness and forgetting things.
