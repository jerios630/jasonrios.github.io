<h2 style="text-align: center;">mezangelle is an Internet-cultural poetic language deriving from incorporating formal code and informal speech at once. It mangles together code and human speech, rendering both non-functional in it's original use, but also creating alternative meaning.</h2>

<p style="text-align: center;">mezengelle takes apart and combines multiple different constructions of programming and informal languages to create digital art with abstract and unexpected meanings. Some of the components that it uses is basic English, ASCII art, emoticons, fragments of different programming languages, and more. While mezengelle itself isn't executable as code, it visually references code and programming language syntax.</p>

<p>mezangelle was developed in the mid-1990's by Mez Breeze an artist, digital media consultant, journalist, researcher, and editor. She began contributing her "mezangelled" emails to the 7-11 listserve, which was dedicated to net art, and net art experimentation, using it as it's earliest testing grounds. During the late-1990's and early-2000's mezangelle utilized mailing lists as a medium of distribution, and as a way to collaborate with other, as well as some chat-oriented software.&nbsp;</p>
