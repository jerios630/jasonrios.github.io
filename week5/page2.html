</div>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Through Breeze's love for poetry, she wanted to use code to dissect her work to create a new and playful meaning never done before. She saw many forms of poetry to be largely linear. With mezangelle, Breeze aimed to make it an interactive experience that would be unique to each individual user, in hopes that each would see infinite number of combinations one could interpret the message created.</h2>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">"Viewers of Mez’s works are not only required to read (and sometimes interact), but to translate the Mezangelle language, which often (if not usually) creates multiple interpretive possibilities. Mez’s interest in playing with—and making as much as she possibly can out of – ASCII code is obvious; the addition of images gives viewers more to work through … Mez works this possibility – with her use of language, and by using images as prefix and suffix—to extreme ends, and by doing so metaphorically hits two, three, or more notes at with a single gathering of letters formed into a word in ways previous generations of writers could not."</h3>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Mezengelle's language is Breeze's way showing the relationship between human and machine. She does this by connecting to various coding repositories to make the initial writing seem rigid and scattered. With the combination of standard english, programming languages, emoticons, and various unique writing conventions; mezangelle is able to come alive.</h3>
