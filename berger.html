Contrasting with other cultures that celebrated their power and wealth by worshiping their Gods, princes, and dynasties through art; medieval European painters had a different mindset. They focused on demonstrating their wealth through celebrating merchandise to prove the quality of their wealth. I believe the European's emphasis on day-to-day things such as food, livestock, and even household items paved the road for the importance that adverstisement has on our current society.
